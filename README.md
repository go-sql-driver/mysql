## Features
  * Lightweight and [fast](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/sql-benchmark "golang MySQL-Driver performance")
  * Native Go implementation. No C-bindings, just pure Go
  * Connections over TCP/IPv4, TCP/IPv6 or Unix Sockets
  * Automatic handling of broken connections
  * Automatic Connection-Pooling *(by database/sql package)*
  * Supports queries larger than 16MB
  * Intelligent `LONG DATA` handling in prepared statements
  * Secure `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` support with file Whitelisting and `io.Reader` support

## Requirements
  * Go 1.0.3 or higher
  * MySQL (Version 4.1 or higher), MariaDB or Percona Server

---------------------------------------

## Installation
Simple install the package to your [$GOPATH](http://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/GOPATH "GOPATH") with the [go tool](http://golang.org/cmd/go/ "go command") from shell:
```bash
$ go get github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql
```
Make sure [Git is installed](http://git-scm.com/downloads) on your machine and in your system's `PATH`.

## Usage
_Go MySQL Driver_ is an implementation of Go's `database/sql/driver` interface, so all you need to do is to import the driver and open a new database connection with the given driver.

Use `mysql` as `driverName` and a valid [DSN](#dsn-data-source-name)  as `dataSourceName`
```go
import "database/sql"
import _ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"

db, e := sql.Open("mysql", "user:password@/dbname?charset=utf8")
```

All further methods are listed here: http://golang.org/pkg/database/sql

[Examples are available in our Wiki](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql/wiki/Examples "Go-MySQL-Driver Examples").


### DSN (Data Source Name)

The Data Source Name has a common format, like e.g. [PEAR DB](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.database.db.intro-dsn.php) uses it, but without type-prefix (optional parts marked by squared brackets):
```
[username[:password]@][protocol[(address)]]/dbname[?param1=value1&paramN=valueN]
```

A DSN in its fullest form:
```
username:password@protocol(address)/dbname?param=value
```

Except of the databasename, all values are optional. So the minimal DSN is:
```
/dbname
```

If you do not want to preselect a database, leave `dbname` empty:
```
/
```

#### Password
Passwords can consist of any character. Escaping is **not** necessary.

#### Protocol
See [net.Dial](http://golang.org/pkg/net/#Dial) for more information which networks are available.
In general you should use an Unix-socket if available and TCP otherwise for best performance.

#### Address
For TCP and UDP networks, addresses have the form `host:port`.
If `host` is a literal IPv6 address, it must be enclosed in square brackets.
The functions [net.JoinHostPort](http://golang.org/pkg/net/#JoinHostPort) and [net.SplitHostPort](http://golang.org/pkg/net/#SplitHostPort) manipulate addresses in this form.

For Unix-sockets the address is the absolute path to the MySQL-Server-socket, e.g. `/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock` or `/tmp/mysql.sock`.

#### Parameters
**Parameters are case-sensitive!**

Possible Parameters are:
  * `timeout`: **Driver** side connection timeout. The value must be a string of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix ( *"ms"*, *"s"*, *"m"*, *"h"* ), such as *"30s"*, *"0.5m"* or *"1m30s"*. To set a server side timeout, use the parameter [`wait_timeout`](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_wait_timeout).
  * `charset`: *"SET NAMES `value`"*. If multiple charsets are set (seperated by a comma), the following charset is used if setting the charset failes. This enables support for `utf8mb4` ([introduced in MySQL 5.5.3](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/charset-unicode-utf8mb4.html)) with fallback to `utf8` for older servers.
  * `allowAllFiles`: `allowAllFiles=true` disables the file Whitelist for `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` and allows *all* files. *Might be insecure!*
  * _(pending)_ <s>`tls`</s>: will enable SSL/TLS-Encryption
  * _(pending)_ <s>`compress`</s>: will enable Compression

All other parameters are interpreted as system variables:
  * `autocommit`: *"SET autocommit='`value`'"*
  * `time_zone`: *"SET time_zone='`value`'"*
  * `tx_isolation`: *"SET [tx_isolation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_tx_isolation)='`value`'"*
  * `param`: *"SET `param`=`value`"*

#### Examples
```
user@unix(/path/to/socket)/dbname
```

```
user:password@tcp(localhost:5555)/dbname?charset=utf8&autocommit=true
```

```
user:password@tcp([de:ad:be:ef::ca:fe]:80)/dbname?charset=utf8mb4,utf8
```

```
user:password@/dbname
```

No Database preselected:
```
user:password@/
```

### `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` support
For this feature you need direct access to the package. Therefore you must change the import path (no `_`):
```go
import "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"
```

Files must be whitelisted by registering them with `mysql.RegisterLocalFile(filepath)` (reccommended) or the Whitelist check must be deactivated by using the DSN parameter `allowAllFiles=true` (might be insecure).

To use a `io.Reader` a handler function must be registered with `mysql.RegisterReaderHandler(name, handler)` which returns a `io.Reader` or `io.ReadCloser`. The Reader is available with the filepath `Reader::<name>` then.

## Testing / Development
To run the driver tests you may need to adjust the configuration. See [this Wiki-Page](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql/wiki/Testing "Testing") for details.
